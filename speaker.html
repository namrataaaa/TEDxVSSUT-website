<span class="speaker-job">- IPS Officer Odisha</span>

<p>Sagarika Nath, Odisha Cadre IPS Officer RR 2016, stands testimony to the genuine pedigree of feminism, shutting all the naysayers without shunning any of the barriers - dismissig the status of policing as a masculine job or triumphing an examination with unbelievable grit against the mental barriers. Her contribution has managed to cross the conventional roles assumed by armchair idealistic officers and enter into the multifaceted issues like human trafficking, drug abuse, paranoia stemming out of the hopelessness and lack of belief in the system. She has raised the bar by engaging in community policing, rescuing 19 female victims, and multitude of other field activities. While the issues stand difficult to surmount, the added stigma of the masculine dominance can only be faced by a selected few and she has managed to clearly send the message of women power back. Tune in on 30th of this September to listen the valiant lady cop sharing her journey and inspiring to be steadfast in one&#39;s dream and hardwork to achieve all that is said impossible.</p>

<p>Suraksha Jain, a budding social entrepreneur, has managed this credit at the age of 16 which is no mean feat. She encompasses diverse activities such as the designing of an e-bicycle to avert pollution, operation of a non-profit organization of sanitary pads to spread awareness, ensure menstrual hygiene and make the product cost-inexpensive, encouraging tobbaco sellers to engage in healthier professions and by teaching in the slum areas at the weekends. Whilst the achievements might sound huge already, the journey that enabled her to develop a vision that can sense opportunity from problems is even more magnificent. The education system post her matriculation pushed her into dysthymia (mild depresssion) and further anaemia. The cruel methods of teaching that are far from educational led her into these phases, which when she recovered made her unstoppable. A period of ups and downs made her to ponder over our educational system and the myth of direct correlation between grades and knowledge. She is in her journey of redefining education that can invite students to be passionate and eventually be satisfied making the entire process interactive and fruitful.</p>

Bereft of Equal Opportunites Act, 30 years back, her dream of becoming an IAS officer was left unfulfilled by a road accident. Bound to a wheelchair, she traversed difficulties that very a few unbounded people can fathom, let alone achieve. With an illustrious academic career, a topper and gold medalist in M.Sc., recipient of Best Student Award in 1978 in Utkal University, National Debating Champion, she qualified the Civil Services Examination in Allied Service. During her preparation to commence her career, she met with a terrible accident. Keeping the tragedy aside, when she decided to move on she was offered a relegated position, which also slipped when she questioned the system. She soon started &quot;Swabhiman&quot;, a cross disability organization, advocating for and serving persons with disabilities, which works at the level of International with Disabled People&#39;s Internation, National with National Disability Network and also in the state. She has also started other NGOs and social service organizations and has assumed the roles of founder, convenor, contributor to various services for mankind.</p>
