# TEDxVSSUT-website
Website designed and maintained by me for TEDxVSSUT 2018.
Purely static website, with only front-end code, completely written in HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. A template for a TED-like site was imported and worked upon.
Site was hosted on Linux based CPanel over GoDaddy servers.

## Site Pages

The following pages were added to the site as development progressed.

### Home
The home page(index.html). First page imported and worked upon.
